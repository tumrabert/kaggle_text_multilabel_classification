# Research Paper Multilable Classification Project

This repository contains code for a Kaggle competition on classifying research papers into multiple subject areas using both traditional and deep learning approaches.

# Chapter 1 : **Introduction**

## Project Purpose

Classified research papers into 18 classes subject areas including

- CE - Civil Engineering
- ENV- Environmental Engineering
- BME - Biomedical Engineering
- PE - Petroleum Engineering
- METAL- Metallurgical Engineering
- ME - Mechanical Engineering
- EE - Electrical Engineering
- CPE - Computer Engineering
- OPTIC - Optical Engineering
- NANO - Nano Engineering
- CHE - Chemical Engineering
- MATENG - Materials Engineering
- AGRI - Agricultural Engineering
- EDU - Education
- IE - Industrial Engineering
- SAFETY - Safety Engineering
- MATH - Mathematics and Statistics
- MATSCI - Material Science

This type of classification supports researchers in finding relevant literature, improves search results in academic databases, and helps to organize collections of scientific publications.

## Multi-label Classification

    I use multi-label classification because a research paper might belong to multiple subject areas. For example, a paper might intersect Biomedical Engineering and Nano technology.

## Project Structure

    This report delves into data preparation, model development, results analysis, discussion of potential improvements, and conclusions.
